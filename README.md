# Basic Web Calculator
*(Replace this placeholder image link with an actual screenshot of your calculator once it's deployed or you take one!)*

A simple, responsive web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was built to practice foundational web development skills and demonstrate the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* **Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Clear Functionality:** "C" button to clear the display.
* **Decimal Support:** Allows for floating-point calculations.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (thanks to CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout).
* **Keyboard Support:** You can use your keyboard's number keys, operators (+, -, \*, /), Enter/Equals, and Escape/C for clearing.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the calculator interface.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout (including CSS Grid for the button arrangement).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For handling the calculator's logic and interactivity (DOM manipulation, event listeners, arithmetic operations).
